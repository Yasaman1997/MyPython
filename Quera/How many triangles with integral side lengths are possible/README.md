The number of triangles with perimeter n
and integer side lengths is given by Alcuin's sequence T(n). The generating function for T(n) is x3(1−x2)(1−x3)(1−x4)

. Alcuin's sequence can be expressed as

T(n)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪[n248][(n+3)248]n evenn odd

where [x]
is the nearest integer function, and thus T(36)=27. See this article by Krier and Manvel for more details. See also Andrews, Jordan/Walch/Wisner, these two by Hirschhorn, and Bindner/Erickson.
